# Feature Request: Service Listing Page

## Overview
A comprehensive service listing page that allows residents to discover and access all council services in an intuitive, categorized format. This page will serve as the primary navigation hub for all council services, similar to Wiltshire Council's service directory but adapted to our existing UX patterns.

## Problem Statement
Residents face challenges in discovering and accessing council services due to fragmented navigation and lack of categorization. This results in higher bounce rates and lower user satisfaction.

## Success Metrics
- Increase service page visits by 40%
- Reduce bounce rate on service-related pages by 20%
- Improve user task completion rates by 30%
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
